# calculator

A calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers and floating-point numbers, featuring a convenient clear function.

This is my attempt at the Calculator project as part of the Odin Project's Foundations Curriculum. 

The calculator uses an object that contains key-value pairs for each mathematical operation (e.g., "รท": divide) to dynamically call the appropriate function for the user's input.
